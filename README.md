# IOTA Experience Team

The IOTA Experience Team is a top-level team in the IOTA community focused on community-facing efforts.

For more details read the [IOTA Experience Team Charter].

## Why does the IOTA Experience Team exist?

The IOTA Experience Team reflects the relevance of the voice of community in IOTA. The formation of this group as a team alongside the IOTA Foundation demonstrates that community-focused contributions are valued by the contributors of IOTA, and that roles other than those of code contributor help foster a healthy, sustainable open source community.

The IOTA Experience Team works to empower people in every part of the project. By focusing on outward-facing community efforts, we aim to make the IOTA projects more diverse and improve the environment for inclusivity, attracting a wider range of views, voices, and opinions, which in turn helps us ship better technologies.

IOTA Experience Team initiatives are formed with the intent of improving the cultural development and outreach within IOTA.

## Contributing

> code commits !== the only means to contributions.

The IOTA Experience Team is tasked with growing and sustaining the IOTA Community. If you're reading this, you're already a part of that community and we'd love to have your help!

Before you get started, here's a broad outline of the IOTA Experience Team's governance structure:

- **IOTA Experience Team:** meta-level admin concerns, cross-cutting with other groups and Working Groups
  - **Initiatives:** focused on specific tasks, independent from the IOTA Experience Team but sharing what they're doing in IOTA Experience Team meetings.

As seen here, most of the community work that immediately affects the project is done within the numerous **initiatives**. We recommend checking the [list of initiatives](#strategic-initiatives) below and getting involved with one that you find interesting! If nothing suits your fancy and you have concrete ideas, open an issue here! We can help to point you in the right direction.

To **get started** with contributing, you should read the [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) document. This document details the roles you can take on. It also includes a guide to contributing and links to `good first issue`s where we're looking for help.

If you're interested in participating in the IOTA Experience Team directly, you're more than welcome to join via the Jitsi link posted in our meeting issues.

## Meetings

IOTA Experience Team meetings are broadcast via Jitsi. The join link is published in the meeting's respective issue. Meeting times are coordinated to optimize for contributor timezones.

## Strategic Initiatives

Initiatives are projects that the IOTA Experience Team and the broader community members are collaborating on to enable IOTA across the ecosystem.

At any one time the IOTA Experience Team has a number of strategic initiatives underway. With the less-tangible approach to the work that the IOTA Experience Team does, having a way to track this work is important.

For each strategic initiative, the IOTA Experience Team's goal is to have a single point of reference - a champion - that understands what's happening with the initiative to the fullest extent possible, and can report on the initiative as needed.

A review of the initiatives will be a standing item on the IOTA Experience Team agenda (even if the update is 'nothing new') as a way to ensure they are active and have the support needed.

## Labels for Issues and PRs

In an effort to be more concise and distribute our knowledge, we do our best to use labels on issues to give context on their status. Here's a guide to how we use labels:

- `initiative-` prefix: Belonging to or about an initiative that follows the prefix.
- `waiting-on-` prefix: This indicates that we're waiting on a group for input/feedback.
- `type-` prefix: Denotes what kind of discussion is happening – a request, an open discussion, a problem, etc.
- `-agenda` suffix: Denotes that an issue will be included in the agenda of the initiative or WG pririor to the suffix.
- `good-first-issue`: Issues that are a good place to start contributing to the IOTA Experience Team
- `mentor-available`: Issues that have a mentor available to help out
