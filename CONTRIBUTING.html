<p><strong>First things first:</strong> If you're unsure of anything, please <em>don't hesitate to ask a question in a discussion or create an issue</em>. Nobody will be upset with you; we'll always try to include you in the work you care about. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. Any kind of contribution, no matter how big or small, helps!</p>
<h2 id="code-of-conduct"><a class="header" href="#code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a></h2>
<p>The Code of Conduct explains the <em>bare minimum</em> behavior
expectations the IOTA Foundation requires from all contributors.
<a href="https://github.com/iota-community/iota-experience-team/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md">Please read it before participating.</a></p>
<h2 id="vocabulary"><a class="header" href="#vocabulary">Vocabulary</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Guest</strong> is any individual who has requested or been requested to attend a IOTA Experience Team meeting.</li>
<li>A <strong>Contributor</strong> is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request.</li>
<li>A <strong>Collaborator</strong> is a contributor who has been given write access to the the repo(s)
relevant to IOTA Experience Team initiatives or working groups.</li>
<li>A <strong>Member</strong> is a collaborator who has met the requirements of
participation to be considered for acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="teams-and-working-groups"><a class="header" href="#teams-and-working-groups">Teams and Working Groups</a></h2>
<p>The IOTA Experience Team represents a collection of teams and working groups that are expressly working toward growing and supporting the overall IOTA community. IOTA as a whole needs a broad range of skills and contributions, which are not necessarily technical in nature, to thrive.</p>
<p>You can see the current Initiatives and Team members in the <a href="https://github.com/iota-community/iota-experience-team/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> file - if there is one that seems to cover an area of particular interest to you, you should take a look at the Team or Working Group's repo to see how you can get further involved.</p>
<h2 id="logging-issues"><a class="header" href="#logging-issues">Logging Issues</a></h2>
<p>Log an issue for any question or problem you might have. When in doubt, log an issue,
any additional policies about what to include will be provided in the responses. The only
exception is security disclosures which should be sent privately. If you have a concern that is Code
of Conduct related and do not feel comfortable reporting publicly, please reach out to an individual listed under IOTA Experience Team Collaborators</p>
<p>Collaborators may direct you to another repository, ask for additional clarifications, and
add appropriate metadata before the issue is addressed.</p>
<p>Please be courteous, respectful, and every participant is expected to follow the
project's Code of Conduct.</p>
<h2 id="contributions"><a class="header" href="#contributions">Contributions</a></h2>
<p>Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests (colloquially referred to as &quot;PRs&quot;). This applies to all changes, both non-code and code: documentation, process-related contributions, binary files, etc. Even long term collaborators and WG members must use pull requests.</p>
<p>No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.</p>
<p>For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 72 hours to ensure that contributors in other timezones have time to review. Consideration should also be given to weekends and other holiday periods to ensure active collaborators all have reasonable time to become involved in the discussion and review process if they wish.</p>
<p>The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no collaborator has an objection. During review collaborators may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a particular area gives a &quot;LGTM&quot; before the PR can be merged. There is no additional &quot;sign off&quot; process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by collaborators are addressed, it can be landed by any collaborator.</p>
<p>In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another collaborator, all involved collaborators should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.</p>
<p>If a contribution is controversial and collaborators cannot agree about how to get it to land or if it should land then it should be escalated to the IOTA Experience Team. IOTA Experience Team members should regularly discuss pending contributions in order to find a resolution. It is expected that only a small minority of issues be brought to the IOTA Experience Team for resolution and that discussion and compromise among collaborators be the default resolution mechanism.</p>
<p>Collaborators are expected to follow this policy and continue to send pull requests, go through proper review, and have other collaborators merge their pull requests.</p>
<h2 id="the-iota-experience-team-process"><a class="header" href="#the-iota-experience-team-process">The IOTA Experience Team Process</a></h2>
<p>The IOTA Experience Team uses a &quot;consensus seeking&quot; process for issues that are escalated to the IOTA Experience Team.
The group tries to find a resolution that has no open objections among the IOTA Experience Team members.
If a consensus cannot be reached that has no objections then a majority wins vote
is called. It is also expected that the majority of decisions made by the IOTA Experience Team are via a consensus seeking process and that voting is only used as a last-resort.</p>
<p>Resolution may involve returning the issue to collaborators with suggestions on how to
move forward towards a consensus. It is not expected that a meeting of the IOTA Experience Team will resolve all issues on its agenda during that meeting and may prefer to continue the discussion happening among the collaborators.</p>
<p>Members can be added to the IOTA Experience Team at any time. Any collaborator can nominate another collaborator to the IOTA Experience Team and the IOTA Experience Team uses its standard consensus seeking process to evaluate whether or not to add this new member. Members who do not participate consistently at the level of a majority of the other members are expected to resign.</p>
