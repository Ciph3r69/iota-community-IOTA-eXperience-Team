<h2 id="what-is-the-vision-behind-the-iota-experience-team-exist"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-vision-behind-the-iota-experience-team-exist">What is the vision behind the IOTA Experience Team exist?</a></h2>
<p>Sustainable open source software is always, first and foremost, a community effort. By its very nature, the health of every project in this domain has as much to do with those consuming the code as it has to do with those maintaining it.</p>
<p>At the IOTA Foundation, we want to open up a feedback loop between our internal development teams and, you, the amazing people doing wonderful things with the protocol. By bringing some of the “real world” back into the development processes, the vision is to offer the opportunity for you to become intimately involved in preparing software for its transition from Alpha to a Full Release.</p>
<p>As a member of the IOTA Experience Team, you won’t be met with demands or endless formalities. By participating in this IOTA Experience Team, you will be empowered to speak as a voice for the community and guide development processes. And at the end of the day, you will have helped yourself, the IOTA Foundation and the whole community to more solid, intuitive, and useful technologies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>code commits !== the only means to contributions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The IOTA Experience Team is tasked with growing and sustaining the IOTA Community. If you're reading this, you're already a part of that community and we'd love to have your help!</p>
<p>Before you get started, here's a broad outline of the IOTA Experience Team's governance structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IOTA Experience Team:</strong> meta-level admin concerns, cross-cutting with other groups and Working Groups
<ul>
<li><strong>Initiatives:</strong> focused on specific tasks, independent from the IOTA Experience Team but sharing what they're doing in IOTA Experience Team meetings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As seen here, most of the community work that immediately affects the project is done within the numerous <strong>initiatives</strong>. We recommend checking the <a href="index.html#strategic-initiatives">list of initiatives</a> below and getting involved with one that you find interesting! If nothing suits your fancy and you have concrete ideas, open an issue here! We can help to point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>To <strong>get started</strong> with contributing, you should read the <a href="./CONTRIBUTING.html">Contributing Guidelines</a> document. This document details the roles you can take on. It also includes a guide to contributing and links to <code>good first issue</code>s where we're looking for help.</p>
<p>If you're interested in participating in the IOTA Experience Team directly, you're more than welcome to join via the Jitsi link posted in our meeting issues.</p>
<h2 id="meetings"><a class="header" href="#meetings">Meetings</a></h2>
<p>IOTA Experience Team meetings are broadcast via Jitsi. The join link is published in the meeting's respective issue. Meeting times are coordinated to optimize for contributor timezones.</p>

<h2 id="strategic-initiatives"><a class="header" href="#strategic-initiatives">Strategic Initiatives</a></h2>
<p>Initiatives are projects that the IOTA Experience Team and the broader community members are collaborating on to enable IOTA across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>At any one time the IOTA Experience Team has a number of strategic initiatives underway. With the less-tangible approach to the work that the IOTA Experience Team does, having a way to track this work is important.</p>
<p>For each strategic initiative, the IOTA Experience Team's goal is to have a single point of reference - a champion - that understands what's happening with the initiative to the fullest extent possible, and can report on the initiative as needed.</p>
<p>A review of the initiatives will be a standing item on the IOTA Experience Team agenda (even if the update is 'nothing new') as a way to ensure they are active and have the support needed.</p>

<p>In an effort to be more concise and distribute our knowledge, we do our best to use labels on issues to give context on their status. Here's a guide to how we use labels:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>initiative-</code> prefix: Belonging to or about an initiative that follows the prefix.</li>
<li><code>waiting-on-</code> prefix: This indicates that we're waiting on a group for input/feedback.</li>
<li><code>type-</code> prefix: Denotes what kind of discussion is happening – a request, an open discussion, a problem, etc.</li>
<li><code>-agenda</code> suffix: Denotes that an issue will be included in the agenda of the initiative or WG pririor to the suffix.</li>
<li><code>good-first-issue</code>: Issues that are a good place to start contributing to the IOTA Experience Team</li>

<h2 id="section-1-guiding-principle"><a class="header" href="#section-1-guiding-principle">Section 1. Guiding Principle.</a></h2>
<p>The IOTA Experience Team will operate transparently, openly, collaboratively, and ethically. Project proposals, timelines, and status must not merely be open, but also easily visible to the entire ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-establishment-of-the-iota-experience-team"><a class="header" href="#section-2-establishment-of-the-iota-experience-team">Section 2. Establishment of the IOTA Experience Team.</a></h2>
<p>Membership is for 6 months. The group will ask on a regular basis if the expiring members would like to stay on. A member just needs to reply to renew. There is no fixed size of the IOTA Experience Team. However, the expected target for Advisors, as defined in Section 6, is between 9 and 12, to ensure adequate coverage of important areas of community expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently.</p>
<p>There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for IOTA Experience Team membership beyond these rules. The IOTA Experience Team may add additional members to the IOTA Experience Team by a standard IOTA Experience Team motion and vote. A IOTA Experience Team member may be removed from the IOTA Experience Team by voluntary resignation, or by a standard IOTA Experience Team motion.</p>
<p>Changes to IOTA Experience Team membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be suggested as any other agenda item.</p>
<p>No more than one-fourth of the IOTA Experience Team members may be affiliated with the same employer or leadership of a community/ecosystem organization. If removal or resignation of a IOTA Experience Team member, or a change of employment by a IOTA Experience Team member, creates a situation where more than one-fourth of the IOTA Experience Team membership shares an employer, then the situation must be immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more IOTA Experience Team members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s). IOTA Foundation members excluded.</p>
<p>The IOTA Experience Team members shall consist of active members of Community Projects.</p>
<p>The IOTA Experience Team may, at its discretion, invite any number of non-voting Guests to participate in the public portion of IOTA Experience Team discussions and meetings.</p>
<p>The IOTA Experience Team shall meet regularly using tools that enable participation by the community (through any appropriate means selected by the IOTA Experience Team). Minutes or an appropriate recording shall be taken and made available to the community through accessible public postings.</p>
<p>IOTA Experience Team members are expected to regularly participate in IOTA Experience Team activities.</p>
<p>In the case where an individual IOTA Experience Team member -- within any three month period -- attends fewer than 25% of the regularly scheduled meetings, does not participate in IOTA Experience Team discussions, and does not participate in IOTA Experience Team votes, the member shall be automatically removed from the IOTA Experience Team. The member may be invited to continue attending IOTA Experience Team meetings as a Guest.</p>

<p>The IOTA Experience Team will establish and maintain a process of support for IOTA community projects. The process will establish guidelines for how culture and values of the community can be supported.</p>
<p>The IOTA Experience Team and entire technical community will follow any processes as may be specified by the Board relating to the intake and license compliance review of contributions, including the IOTA Foundation's IP Policy.</p>
<h2 id="section-5-roles"><a class="header" href="#section-5-roles">Section 5. Roles</a></h2>
<p>The git repositories for the IOTA Experience Team and its initiatives are maintained by the IOTA Experience Team and additional Collaborators who are added by the IOTA Experience Team on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Individuals making significant and valuable contributions, “Contributor(s)”, are made Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These individuals are identified by the IOTA Experience Team and their addition as Collaborators is discussed during the weekly IOTA Experience Team meeting. Modifications of the contents of the git repository are made on a collaborative basis as defined in the development process.</p>
<p>Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to the IOTA Experience Team for discussion by assigning the <code>cc-agenda</code> tag to a pull request or issue. The IOTA Experience Team should serve as the final arbiter where required. The IOTA Experience Team will maintain and publish a list of current Collaborators by Project, as well as a development process guide for Collaborators and Contributors looking to participate in the development effort.</p>
<h2 id="section-6-definitions"><a class="header" href="#section-6-definitions">Section 6. Definitions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Contributors: contribute code or other artifacts, but do not have the right to commit to the code base. Contributors work with the Project’s Collaborators to have code committed to the code base. A Contributor may be promoted to a Collaborator by the projects’ Maintainer or the IOTA Experience Team. Contributors should rarely be encumbered by the IOTA Experience Team and never by the Board.</li>
<li>Project: a collaboration effort, e.g. a subsystem, that is organized through the project creation process and approved by the IOTA Experience Team.</li>
<li>Community Project: projects within the IOTA Foundation or in the IOTA Ecosystem that contribute to the health of the IOTA project.</li>
<li>Advisor: a Collaborator within a Community Project elected to represent the Community Project on the IOTA Experience Team.</li>

<p><strong>First things first:</strong> If you're unsure of anything, please <em>don't hesitate to ask a question in a discussion or create an issue</em>. Nobody will be upset with you; we'll always try to include you in the work you care about. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. Any kind of contribution, no matter how big or small, helps!</p>
<h2 id="code-of-conduct"><a class="header" href="#code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a></h2>
<p>The Code of Conduct explains the <em>bare minimum</em> behavior
expectations the IOTA Foundation requires from all contributors.
<a href="https://github.com/iota-community/iota-experience-team/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md">Please read it before participating.</a></p>
<h2 id="vocabulary"><a class="header" href="#vocabulary">Vocabulary</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Guest</strong> is any individual who has requested or been requested to attend a IOTA Experience Team meeting.</li>
<li>A <strong>Contributor</strong> is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request.</li>
<li>A <strong>Collaborator</strong> is a contributor who has been given write access to the the repo(s)
relevant to IOTA Experience Team initiatives or working groups.</li>
<li>A <strong>Member</strong> is a collaborator who has met the requirements of
participation to be considered for acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="teams-and-working-groups"><a class="header" href="#teams-and-working-groups">Teams and Working Groups</a></h2>
<p>The IOTA Experience Team represents a collection of teams and working groups that are expressly working toward growing and supporting the overall IOTA community. IOTA as a whole needs a broad range of skills and contributions, which are not necessarily technical in nature, to thrive.</p>
<p>You can see the current Initiatives and Team members in the <a href="https://github.com/iota-community/iota-experience-team/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> file - if there is one that seems to cover an area of particular interest to you, you should take a look at the Team or Working Group's repo to see how you can get further involved.</p>
<h2 id="logging-issues"><a class="header" href="#logging-issues">Logging Issues</a></h2>
<p>Log an issue for any question or problem you might have. When in doubt, log an issue,
any additional policies about what to include will be provided in the responses. The only
exception is security disclosures which should be sent privately. If you have a concern that is Code
of Conduct related and do not feel comfortable reporting publicly, please reach out to an individual listed under IOTA Experience Team Collaborators</p>
<p>Collaborators may direct you to another repository, ask for additional clarifications, and
add appropriate metadata before the issue is addressed.</p>
<p>Please be courteous, respectful, and every participant is expected to follow the
project's Code of Conduct.</p>
<h2 id="contributions"><a class="header" href="#contributions">Contributions</a></h2>
<p>Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests (colloquially referred to as &quot;PRs&quot;). This applies to all changes, both non-code and code: documentation, process-related contributions, binary files, etc. Even long term collaborators and WG members must use pull requests.</p>
<p>No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.</p>
<p>For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 72 hours to ensure that contributors in other timezones have time to review. Consideration should also be given to weekends and other holiday periods to ensure active collaborators all have reasonable time to become involved in the discussion and review process if they wish.</p>
<p>The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no collaborator has an objection. During review collaborators may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a particular area gives a &quot;LGTM&quot; before the PR can be merged. There is no additional &quot;sign off&quot; process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by collaborators are addressed, it can be landed by any collaborator.</p>
<p>In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another collaborator, all involved collaborators should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.</p>
<p>If a contribution is controversial and collaborators cannot agree about how to get it to land or if it should land then it should be escalated to the IOTA Experience Team. IOTA Experience Team members should regularly discuss pending contributions in order to find a resolution. It is expected that only a small minority of issues be brought to the IOTA Experience Team for resolution and that discussion and compromise among collaborators be the default resolution mechanism.</p>
<p>Collaborators are expected to follow this policy and continue to send pull requests, go through proper review, and have other collaborators merge their pull requests.</p>
<h2 id="the-iota-experience-team-process"><a class="header" href="#the-iota-experience-team-process">The IOTA Experience Team Process</a></h2>
<p>The IOTA Experience Team uses a &quot;consensus seeking&quot; process for issues that are escalated to the IOTA Experience Team.
The group tries to find a resolution that has no open objections among the IOTA Experience Team members.
If a consensus cannot be reached that has no objections then a majority wins vote
is called. It is also expected that the majority of decisions made by the IOTA Experience Team are via a consensus seeking process and that voting is only used as a last-resort.</p>
<p>Resolution may involve returning the issue to collaborators with suggestions on how to
move forward towards a consensus. It is not expected that a meeting of the IOTA Experience Team will resolve all issues on its agenda during that meeting and may prefer to continue the discussion happening among the collaborators.</p>
<p>Members can be added to the IOTA Experience Team at any time. Any collaborator can nominate another collaborator to the IOTA Experience Team and the IOTA Experience Team uses its standard consensus seeking process to evaluate whether or not to add this new member. Members who do not participate consistently at the level of a majority of the other members are expected to resign.</p>
